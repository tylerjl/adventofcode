          Last year, <a href="https://github.com/topaz">@topaz</a> ran a coding challenge site called <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> over the holidays.
          Though I initially completed a few in my lingua franca (ruby) just for fun, some challenges presented some interesting problems that forced solutions that were a bit more engineered than a few lines of script.
          I decided to try and solve all of them in Haskell in order to stretch myself as I haven't done a whole lot of work in (functional|pure|lazy) languages very much, if at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took advantage of a small project with only myself at the helm to fully explore different aspects of the Haskell ecosystem: <a href="https://www.haskellstack.org/">stack</a> (the new Haskell build tool), various testing and benchmarking libraries, and some high-performance libraries like <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa">Repa</a> to understand what high-performing Haskell code looks like.
          Some of what you'll see is very much overkill, but it touches most aspects of the Haskell ecosystem in an education and demonstrative way.

        </h3>
        <p>
          All of the source code is hosted on GitHub.
          In addition, the <code>README</code> is pretty straightforward if you want to build it yourself: <code>stack</code> makes the process <em>very</em> convenient.

        <p>
          The Haskell documentation tool <a href="https://www.haskell.org/haddock/">Haddock</a> is the de facto documentation generation tool, so the solution HTML documentation is provided as an example of what that process looks like.
          Note the <code>Source</code> links accompanying the functions and datatypes if you're curious about what inline Haddock documentation looks like.
